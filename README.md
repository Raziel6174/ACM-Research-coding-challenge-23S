# Michael Figueroa, ACM Research coding challenge submission (Spring 2023)

Note: I started my research application 1/30, learned how to use github, learned to use kaggle, and learned python in two days. This was probably unnecessary but I definitely took it as a challenge and saw it through.

## What did I do?
Inspired by the Hertzsprung Russell Diagram, I decided to take the visualization of the stars' data a step further. I created a 3D scatterplot capable of displaying 4 different pieces of star data. Making use of variables, different data can be displayed with a simple modification of the code. Here is an example of what the code currently displays with the built in data request:

---------------------------
Only official documentation was used in the making of this code, in addition to a couple tutorials used to understand python. The help() and dir() functions were used a LOT:
